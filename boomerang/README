# Performed with reposurgeon 2.40

# Git repo cleaning gets rid of large binary files that never should've
# been committed in the first place. We do lose some important stuff here though
# (like compiled working executables) so the original svn repo is important.

# Get the repo fresh from SF SVN
make boomerang-mirror

# Work around SF svn url oddity
ln -s code-mirror boomerang-mirror

# Make git repo
make

# Clean the repo
cd boomerang-git
../cleangitrepo.sh
