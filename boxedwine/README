# Performed with reposurgeon 3.43

# Git repo cleaning gets rid of large binary files that never should've
# been committed in the first place, as well as some branches we
# probably don't care about. Some care is taken to try and keep the repo
# history in a state that will work, but it's not actully tested.

# Get the repo fresh from SF SVN
make boxedwine-mirror

# Make git repo
make

# Clean the repo
cd boxedwine-git
../cleangitrepo.sh
